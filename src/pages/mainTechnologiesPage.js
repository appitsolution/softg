                  Flutter is a mobile UI framework from Google, designed to
                  create high-quality native iOS and Android interfaces in a
                  relatively short time. Using Flutter, we write native
                  applications on both platforms with the same base code (in
                  Dart). For us, Flutter is extremely intuitive and easy to
                  understand, especially the way to build the user interface.
                  All popular widgets standardized by Material Design or iOS
                  from Cupertino are available in Flutter. The documentation for
                  each Flutter widget and class is detailed and understandable

                  Vue.js is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for
                  building user interfaces. The framework allows you to create
                  both simple components, as well as advanced and scalable SPA
                  (Single-Page Application) applications. Vue.js JavaScript
                  library allows you to create simple web applications based on
                  the Model-View View Model (MVVM), consisting of components.
                  This library is distinguished by many intuitive add-ons and
                  functions that are a great support for software developers.

                  Vue.js is a great alternative to a much more complicated and
                  complex Angular or React. The person responsible for creating
                  Vue.js is Evan You. This is a person known in the world of

                  Laravel is a framework built on Symfony components. Laravel
                  uses Symfony as its framework, but complements it with its
                  logic for writing PHP software. The primary domain for Laravel
                  is the intuitiveness and the pace of writing software.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Laravel already provides us with some of the tools necessary
                  for the work. Eloquent ORM or Vue.js the service of which we
                  get out of the box can be examples here. The advantage of
                  Laravel is the pace of writing a code without the need to
                  create complex and extensive code lines.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Unlike Symfony, this framework supports system authorization,
                  and our configuration is limited to configuring the database
                  during migration only.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  As the template engine, Laravel uses the Blade engine. For us,
                  this is a better solution than Twig. At the basic level, both
                  solutions are relatively similar to each other in terms of
                  their operation. The distinguishing feature of Blade is the
                  ability to place the code directly in the file with the
                  template.

                  extend the functions of an already written code easily. It is
                  worth emphasizing that Symfony has an open-source structure,
